# BayMax
Here is my simple Python GUI which serves as an application software which prompt the user that he has been using the computer continuously for the past 2 hours


## How it started?
```
One day just usually the same day as for me everyday, I was eagerly using my new PC
But it never came to my mind that I have been using my PC for past 6 hours without any break's :(
It intentionaly struck my mind that I shouldn't be doing this I need to take a break...
but didn't know where to start, and all I know is some Python basics , so it came to my mind how 
can a noobie build and app out off python.. so instead of going for the app I did create a program 
that will prompt the user just by opening a youtube video in webbrowser (you can try that just by 
running the breaktime.py)
Then I went for hardcoding the python script just to increase its functionality and the end we had BayMax
And i have deployed it for public download in my website www.rift.bookmark.com ( you can try from there as
well as download my attached exe file )
